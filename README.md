# Modern JavaScript

Introduction to JavaScript in website production, most of the files used are exercises from The Net Ninja channel in the course of the Youtuber channel in its free modern JavaScript course. The content was also taken from Zac Gordon's channel where he talks about using JavaScript for WordPress.

# Goals

Understand the use of JavaScript in the production of websites. This repository is part of my front-end studies. 
This repository is focused on JavaScript to make it possible later to create responsive and beautiful sites and later, to deepen my studies and start in Frameworks such as React, Vue.js, Angular and others.
